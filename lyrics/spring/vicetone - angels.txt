Oh God I'm going insane
Chasing after you, please don't leave me
I see your heart watching away
And that's how you left me in the cold

It's pitiful how you let me lose
You better run, better run
Your time is out, nothing you can do
Better run, better run

I can't remember when you hurt me so bad
But now the tables turn, apocalypse is coming
I can't remember when you left me so sad
But in the end I learned it rains in hell and angels could be bad

Some say I'm losing my faith
But I know I'm just living on a prayer
Time keeps slipping away
I'll watch you burn down these vows that we made

It's pitiful how you let me lose
You better run, better run
Your time is out, nothing you can do
Better run, better run

I can't remember when you hurt me so bad
But now the tables turn, apocalypse is coming
I can't remember when you left me so sad
But in the end I learned it rains in hell and angels could be bad

Oh God I'm going insane
But I know I'm just living on a prayer
I see your heart watching away
And that's how you left me in the cold

Oh God I'm going insane
Chasing after you, please don't leave me
I see your heart watching away
Better run, better run

I can't remember when you hurt me so bad
But now the tables turn, apocalypse is coming
I can't remember when you left me so sad
But in the end I learned it rains in hell and angels could be bad

I can't remember when you hurt me so bad
But now the tables turn, apocalypse is coming
I can't remember when you left me so sad
But in the end I learned it rains in hell and angels could be bad
