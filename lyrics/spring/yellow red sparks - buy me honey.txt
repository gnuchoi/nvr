What are you going to buy me honey?
What are you going to soften me up with tonight?
Why do you think that I’m running?
Get out quickly get out from your knife!

There’s a high way it’s my way
You’re taking the lead from my hand
And the cold strength that I’ve saved
Will call in relief when you’re mad

But you surprise me honey
What are you going to suffer yourself with tonight?
Why do you think that I’m running?
Get out quickly get out from your knife (all your knives)

There’s a high way it’s my way
You’re taking the leap from my hand
And the cold strength that I’ve saved
Well call in relief when you’re mad

So sharpen me quickly
You sharpen me well
You saw (sight/vision) through me quickly
You saw (cut/slice) through me well

There’s a high way it’s my way
I’m taking the lead from your hand
And the pulled strings that I’ve frayed
That calls in relief when you’re mad
To call in relief when you’re mad
