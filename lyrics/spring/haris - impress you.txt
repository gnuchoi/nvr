What does it take to impress you, yes you
What does it take to impress you, yes you
I gotta get one step closer, keep my eyes wide open cause my mind is blowing up on things I like to do with you should think way slower keep my head from going my desires are stronger than the volume and capacity of me
You've got me going crazy, ooho, you've got me going crazy
What does it take to impress you, yes you
What does it take to get next to you, I will do
Anything to get connected with a thin string attached
To a part of your body by choice
Well I was thinking about us with no one around
in a candle light room making love to the last love needs us
I wanna make this come true
Just gotta get one step closer, can't control all my emotions cause I'm just so strung out on you
Yeaah, you got me going crazy
Ohoo you've got me going crazy
What does it take to impress you, yes you
What does it take to get next to you, I will do
Anything to get connected with a thin string attached
To a part of your body by choice
We would make some love but things weren't hot enough
got to make you feel like you never felt before, but impress, undress, forget is the thing that you can get when you get wet out of bed
WHA-T does it take to impress you, yes you
What does it take to get next to you, I will do - oh no no -
Anything to get connected with a thin string attached
To a part your body by choice
What does it take to impress you, yes you
What does it take to get next to you, I will do
Anything to get connected with a thin string attached
To a part of your body by choice
What does it take to impress you
