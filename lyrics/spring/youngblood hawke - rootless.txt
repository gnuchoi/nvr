The world is feeling warmer
The path rolling to your door is a jungle
I'll be back because I never left

Down the dirty sidewalks stream
Dressed in their finest dreams
All the gold and revelry
Like the ghosts of New Orleans

Pupils bigger than the canyons in the sea
Darling, what would you do if you were me?
If you were me, twisted in the vines
Hoping that you would see

I'm feeling rootless in my wandering mind
Time is moving, it's moving

I see you creep into my room like smoke
Under my door, I can feel you in my throat
You ain't no good but you're good enough
I'll give you all my time but not my love

'Cause I'm trying to bring it home
But you're standing in my way
Bandits with red handkerchiefs
Covering their face

It takes a whole lot to shake
Don't get caught up in the time spent
You're walking round in circles
Asking where the time went

I'm feeling rootless in my wandering mind
Time is moving while I'm feeling rootless
Without you I am rootless, I am moving

I'm feeling rootless, so I keep on moving
I'm feeling rootless, so I keep on moving on

I'm feeling rootless in my wandering mind
Time is moving while I'm feeling rootless
Without you I am rootless, I am moving
