There's spring in the air
They're sweeping the streets
Wind is a breeze 
The sun becomes her he agrees

What's holding up her face? 
Nothing but blue skies
Passage ways to windows
That don't close

Where do you live?
Love is a place
Where are you from?
She says, ask yourself ask anyone
What's holding up her face 
Nothing but blue skies
Passage ways the mind's eye
Contemplates
