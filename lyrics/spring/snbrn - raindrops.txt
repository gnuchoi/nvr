[Verse 1]
Like raindrops from the desert sky
For you I've be waiting
Like seeing stars and endless nights
For you I'll be waiting

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I can breathe
Finally
Can we stay like this forever?

[Chorus](3x)
Won't you take me over?
Come a little bit closer
A little bit closer
And wake up together
Bring me up from the under
A little bit closer
A little bit closer
Can we stay like this forever?

[Verse 2]
Like raindrops from the desert sky
For you I've be waiting
With your touch I come alive
For you I'll be waiting
