Dear Marie,
Tell me what it was I used to be?
Oh, dear Marie,
Tell me what it was I used to be?

And if you're further up the road can you show me what I still can't see

Remember me?
I'm the boy you used to love when you were 15
Remember me?
I'm the boy you used to love when you were 15

Now I wonder what you think when you see me in a magazine

From time to time I'll go looking for your photograph online
From time to time I'll go looking for your photograph online

But some county judge in Ohio is all I ever find

[Solo]

Dear Marie,
Tell me do you still believe in me?
Oh, dear Marie,
Tell me do you still believe in me?

Well, I got my dream, but you got a family
Yeah, I got that dream, but you got yourself a family
Yeah, I got that dream, but I guess it got away from me

Oh ah oh [repeated]
