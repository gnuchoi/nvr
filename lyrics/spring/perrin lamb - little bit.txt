There's a little bit of sunshine, in all you do
There's a little bit of sunshine, breaking through
Every little raincloud envys you
There's a little bit of sunshine, in all you

A little bit of rainfall to wash you clean
And a little bit of bluesky to make life green
Every little mayflower envys you
There's a little bit of sunshine, in all you do
