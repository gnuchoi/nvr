When it went down, it was so hard to breathe
I gave up everything, and I fall, fall down to the floor
life was escaping me, I couldn't find myself
'til it was all lost, not anymore

I'm holding on to all the pieces of my hearts debris, 'til it's time
I'll... I'll pull it together and fix myself eventually, I know it's mine

I found gold in the wreckage, put it on a necklace
keeping it 'cause I, I know that it's mine
I wear it like a message, so I don't forget it
keeping it 'cause I, I know that it's mine
I know that it's mine, no matter what I do,
I know that it's mine, whether I win or lose
and even though my heart needs to take its time,
I know that it's mine, I know that it's mine

Facing the change, but it's still tough to see
at first I fought it all, I was so mean
I'm still unsure, how it's supposed to be
I'm taking every day now by the skin of my teeth, until I learn

I'm holding on to all the pieces of my hearts debris, 'til it's time
I'll... I'll pull it together and fix myself eventually, I know it's mine

I found gold in the wreckage, put it on a necklace
keeping it 'cause I, I know that it's mine
I wear it like a message, so I don't forget it
keeping it 'cause I, I know that it's mine
I know that it's mine, no matter what I do,
I know that it's mine, whether I win or lose
and even though my heart needs to take its time,
I know that it's mine, I know that it's mine

I found gold in the wreckage, put it on a necklace
keeping it 'cause I, I know that it's mine
I wear it like a message, so I don't forget it
keeping it 'cause I, I know that it's mine
I know that it's mine, no matter what I do,
I know that it's mine, whether I win or lose
and even though my heart needs to take its time,
I know that it's mine, I know that it's mine
