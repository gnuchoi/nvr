She's got a thousand friends 
but she still seems alone 
It doesn't bother her 
she just loves and gives wherever she goes 
And when her soul shines through 
oh it shines so bright 
Like the sun hitting your face 
down the beach at first light 

Her sky blue eyes 
The curl of her hair 
Is more than enough, more than enough 
to hold my stare 
And gazing in her eyes 
I see her grow old 
I want to be around 
To see her evolve 

Underneath all the drinks and smokes 
Is a little girl I used to know 
Remember as she softly spoke 
About what it is that made her dance 

She's the evening elegance 
I see her dance 

Now she's headed out 
to another place 
Armed with nothing but her nature 
And her smiling face 
The people will adore her 
wonder what makes her be 
I just close my eyes 
So I can clearly see 

her dance 
She's the evening elegance 
See her dance 
See her dance 
See her dance
