They call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
They call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I don't carry me no load

Ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no change in me
There ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no change in me
I'm not hidin' from nobody
Nobody's hidin' from me

I got that green light babe
I got to keep movin' on
I got that green light babe
I got to keep movin' on
I might go to California
I might go down to Georgia
I don't know
