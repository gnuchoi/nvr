Strawberry shimmer on hot lips,
Silver buckle hangin' off her hips.
Eyes sparkle when she smiles.
Shinedown on the radio dial.
Homemade jar o' lemon drop, take a sip.
Don't stop girl, you know I love it when you get your shine on!
'Cause you and me be rocking all night long!
Summer sky dripping rhinestones,
Turn your party lights on,
Baby get your shine on - shine on!

Baby get your shine on!

Silverado, candy painted,
Ray Bans, got the whole world shaded.
Chrome piece tucked in the console,
Riding high, roll up on the down low.
Feeling lucky, got hooked up with some Kentucky clear.
So slide that little sugar shaker over here...
And get your shine on!
'Cause you and me be rocking all night long!
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones,
Turn your party lights on,
Baby get your shine on - shine on!
