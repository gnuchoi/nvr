We let bygones be bygones
September's long but
We light a candle and wait for dawn
Night under the trees
We breathe black cold air, black cold air

Together we're Pstereo
Soundless messages without a word
We share our little secrects

I think we are

Together we're Pstereo
So let's do it like it's Pstereo
Together we're Pstereo

Do you hear the breeze, i'm on branches without leaves
Up there's more than a little bird
Here lies the once pale
We are who they once were
We are who they once were

Together we're Pstereo
Soundless messages without a word
We share our little secrects

And i think we are
Together we're Pstereo
So let's do it like it's Pstereo
Together we're Pstereo

There's no questions
Without an answer
The winds wingless friends
Becomes invisible
In bright daylight
In bright daylight

I think we are

Together we're Pstereo
So let's do it like it's Pstereo
Together we're Pstereo

I think we are

Together we're Pstereo
So let's do it like it's Pstereo
Together we're Pstereo

I think we are

Together we're Pstereo
So let's do it like it's Pstereo
Together we're Pstereo
