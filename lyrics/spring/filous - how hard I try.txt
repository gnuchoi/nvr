I’m holding on, too many things passed
To anything that's gonna change my memories back
I’m holding on, to everyone good
To everything that's ever been the way that it should
I’m holding on, to things you said
Before you forgot what this love really meant to you
The words that I sent to you now forgot into you

No matter how hard I try, try
No matter how hard I try, try
No matter how hard I try, try
No matter how hard I try
No matter how hard I try, try, try
No matter how hard I try

(No matter how hard I try)

I’m holding on, too many things passed
To anything that's gonna change my memories back
I’m holding on, to everyone good
To everything that's ever been the way that it should
I’m holding on, to things you said
Before you forgot what this love really meant to you
The words that I sent to you now forgot into you

No matter how hard I try, try
No matter how hard I try, try
No matter how hard I try, try
No matter how hard I try
No matter how hard I try, try, try
No matter how hard I try
