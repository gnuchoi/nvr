[Verse 1]
Take whatever's left of me
Take what you can
Right here next to me
You're all I am
This is our destiny
You can have all my love
My love, my love, my love

[Pre-Chorus]
Just what it's supposed to be
This can't be fair
Look how close we could be
I need this, I swear
Look what you turned out to be
Look what you have become
Become, become, become

[Chorus]
The air
You've become my all
You are everything The reason i'm alive at all
You are The air
The reason why I talk
The reason I can breathe
The reason alive at all, at all

[Verse 2]
Hearts will fail, hearts will fail
Whatever may come
Your the only truth to me
The only one
You're the only thing I need
The only love
I want, I want, I want, I want

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Outro] x5
Baby stay close so I don't choke
Stay close so I don't choke
