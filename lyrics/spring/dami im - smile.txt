You're out of touch, in overtime
You're running in, you're running
Better left behind
You've dropped the ball to catch it with
And is it all there really is
You're thinking but you're thinking
'Cause you know the best all things in life are free
And it's all you need

You gotta live your life
You gotta treat you right
You gotta give into the great thing appetite
You gotta shake it up,
You gotta hold it down
You gotta do all the things that
Make you smile, make you smile
With the fun, but it is that really makes you happy
Yeah let's say that
Let the world be a world that you fill with smile

You're beautiful and evergreen
You're dancing on high hopes and you got big dreams
So let them shine we'll light it up

'Cause now's the time to find your voice
Wear your heart out on your sleeve
'Cause you know the best all things in life are free
And it's all you need

You gotta live your life
You gotta treat you right
You gotta give into the great thing appetite
You gotta shake it up,
You gotta hold it down
You gotta do all the things that
Make you smile, make you smile
With the fun, but it is that really makes you happy
Yeah let's say that
Let the world be a world that you fill with smile

So live for a night we won't forget
Live for the memories we haven't made yet
Turn up the love fall into it
Live for the memories we haven't made yet
This is our life no regrets

You gotta live your life
You gotta treat you right
You gotta give into the great thing appetite
You gotta shake it up,
You gotta hold it down
You gotta do all the things that
Make you smile, make you smile
With the fun, but it is that really makes you happy
Yeah let's say that
Let the world be a world that you fill with smile
