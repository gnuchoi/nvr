If you're looking for a diamond
You gotta sift through the gold
If you're searching for a way out
You gotta take a new road

If you don't keep the motion moving
It can all feel the same
In the heart of the city 
Where the streets are the veins

Oh, when I'm running low
Oh, when the rivers dry
Oh, can you help me go on?

ONE MORE TIME
We're gonna get up for this
We're never gonna 
RUN AND HIDE
If I get tired and say that I wanna 
CHANGE MY MIND
Pull me in a circle, so I can change it
ONE MORE TIME
Pull me in circle

Oh, I know this is heavy
Like a weight on your back
But I think that we can carry
Carry on till the last

And we're laughing and crying oceans
At the smallest of things
But it feels so much better
When we find the release

Oh, like a broken light
Oh, in the blackest night
Oh, can you flip the switch on?

ONE MORE TIME
We're gonna get up for this
We're never gonna 
RUN AND HIDE
If I get tired and say that I wanna 
CHANGE MY MIND
Pull me in a circle, so I can change it
ONE MORE TIME
Pull me in circle

I don't know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
And it's never in the knowing, 
It's in the not giving in

And when the earth is slipping, tripping
Right underneath our feet
Remember we're not finished
We're not finished

ONE MORE TIME
We're gonna get up for this
We're never gonna 
RUN AND HIDE
If I get tired and say that I wanna 
CHANGE MY MIND
Pull me in a circle, so I can change it
ONE MORE TIME
Pull me in circle

ONE MORE TIME
We're gonna get up for this
We're never gonna 
RUN AND HIDE
If I get tired and say that I wanna 
CHANGE MY MIND
Pull me in a circle, so I can change it
ONE MORE TIME
Pull me in circle
