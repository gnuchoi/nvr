Maybe it could amaze me 
If I would step outside my door
And ran, cause it will surely happen
Discovering all that land and sea
And no one knows but me.

Chorus: 
And I, I've got nothing to do today
And I don't want it any other way
So I, I'm gonna sail myself away
Cause I've got nothing to do today, oh

I go where the wind goes
Whatever I build inside my head.
Lately, I've got a whole light sparking me
Don't wanna lose that lonely glow
The only thing I know!

Chorus: 
And I, I've got nothing to do today
And I don't want it any other way
So I am gonna sail myself away
Cause I've got nothing to do today
I've got nothing to do today!

Feel that hope rising
The sun is shining, find the light in anything!
Maybe it could amaze me 
If I would step outside my door

Chorus: 
And I, I've got nothing to do today
And I don't want it any other way
So I, I,m gonna sail myself away
Cause I've got nothing to do today
I've got nothing to do today!
