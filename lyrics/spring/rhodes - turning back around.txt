There's water on the ground,
I'm buying my story
I don't know how shallow it is
Can you tell? Can you tell just by looking at me?!
Well I need to get across,
But my hands are tied by my side
Can you swing? Can you swing just by kicking out?
I didn't mean no harm,
I didn't mean no harm
Now I'm hiding from everyone I know
Can't tell 'em what I know
I'm lying to everyone I know,
Can't tell 'em what I know
and no, I'm not turning back around!

Uh my gentle moves low
You don't know how long it have been
Can you tell? Can you tell just by looking at me?!
Well, I didn't mean no harm,
I didn't mean no harm
Now I'm hiding from everyone I know
Can't tell 'em what I know
I'm lying to everyone I know,
Can't tell 'em what I know
and no, I'm not turning back around!

I'm not turning back around!
I'm not turning back around!
I'm not turning back around!
I'm not turning back around!

[Outro: ]
I heard you, I heard you on
I heard you, I heard you on
I heard you, I heard you on
I heard you, I heard you on
I heard you, I heard you on
I heard you, I heard you on

I'm not turning back around!
I'm not turning back around!
