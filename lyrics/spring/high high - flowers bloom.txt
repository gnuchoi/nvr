When the flowers bloom
Living in the spring time

We came for to
Sail on the sea

Some people, they want you
Lifting all your limbs

We keep your eyesight
On the ball

When you reach the wall
And give in to what you see

On the windy ocean
Far from me

Some people, they want you
Tripping at your feet

We keep your eyesight
Faithful
