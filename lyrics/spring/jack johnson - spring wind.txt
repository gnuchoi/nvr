I lived awhile without you,
Darn near half my life.
I no longer see our unborn children,
Born to you my unwed wife.
But yesterday I had a vision,
Beneath the tree where we once talked,
Of an old couple burning
Their love letters so their children
Won't be shocked.

[Chorus:]
Love calls like the wild birds-
It's another day.
A Spring wind blew my list of
Things to do...away.

My friends are gettin older,
So I guess I must be too.
Without their loving kindness,
I don't know what I'd do.
Oh the wine bottle's half empty-
The money's all spent.
And we're a cross between our parents
And hippies in a tent.

[Chorus]

In a mucked up lovely river,
I cast my little fly.
I look at that river and smell it
And it makes me wanna cry.
Oh to clean our dirty planet,
Now there's a noble wish,
And I'm puttin my shoulder to the wheel
'cause I wanna catch some fish.
