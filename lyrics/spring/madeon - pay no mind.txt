She was dancing, she was smiling
This was blooming in your cheeks
Inner quiet, kind of litany
She accepted from the feet
And then she turned into my arms
Of disgrace, and then repelled
Now she's fallen to her knees,
But you couldn't ever tell

And then, she asked me how we got here
I told her I don't know
And if you keep on asking
I'll just keep saying
So, this isn't what I wanted
It isn't what you need
But let them keep on talking
Just calm yourself and
Pay, don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now don't you pay them (any mind)

Let it burn, as if we'd bothered
We'll make sound based off their eyes
As she closes, just to open
It's some sirens rolling by
And as she's off to tell her secret
To her friends somewhere in town
And her friend just takes a moment
And that's why I'm not around

Darling, this is something
I should have told you long ago
I just want you to feel safe
I just want to make you glow
But how you glowed when we were young
And with nothing on our minds
When you jump, for your love
Baby you're nothing long of time

And then, she asked me how we got here
I told her I don't know
And if you keep on asking
I'll just keep saying
So, this isn't what I wanted
It isn't what you need
But let them keep on talking
Just calm yourself and
Pay, don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now don't you pay them any mind

Why did we have to, go further every time

Some days you hear it (don't listen, I'll carry you)
Some days you don't (to the universe we'll never go)
Sometimes you feel it (it's not worth it, help me)
Sometimes you won't

Just calm yourself and
Pay, don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now don't you pay them any mind
