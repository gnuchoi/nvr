All that you give
Is what you don't deliver
Stuck in a phase
Misguided by mistakes
Your addictive poison is dragging me down
Trying to swim out I'm stuck you're watching me drown

Lying awake
The colours all fade
From the tears on my face
I've let you slip away
I can kiss whoever, I'm wearing the crown
Time to get out my love don’t want you cause now

I'm high and rising
Alive now, I'm fine cause I let you go
I'm high and rising
Alive now, I'm fine cause I let you go

I'm fine cause I let you go

All that you give 
Is what you don't deliver
Stuck in a phase
Misguided by mistakes
Your addictive poison is dragging me down
Trying to swim out I'm stuck you're watching me drown

Lying awake
The colours all fade
From the tears on my face
I've let you slip away
I can kiss whoever, I'm wearing the crown
Time to get out, my love don’t want you cause now

I'm high and rising
Alive now, I'm fine cause I let you go

I'm fine cause I let you go
I'm fine cause I let you go

I'm high and rising
Alive now, I'm fine cause I let you go
I'm high and rising
Alive now, I'm fine cause I let you go
