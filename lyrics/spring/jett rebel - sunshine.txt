I wanna lock you up 'cause I can't sleep at night,
sunshine
sunshine
When the food tastes best
and the girls wear less,
sunshine
It's so cold outside,
I don't even wanna get out.
So sorry about all the new bikini's you don't get to wear
(I'm ready, you're ready)
You're ready for sunshine
When the food tastes best
and the girls wear less,
sunshine
You're ready for sunshine
sunshine
sunshine
(sunshine)
sunshine
(sunshine)
sunshine
Pinch me,
for I am dreaming
Feeling anyone
but me
Pinch me,
for I am dreaming
but not asleep
Sunshine
Keeping me waiting for
sunshine
When the food tastes best
sunshine
And the girls wear less
sunshine
Keeping me waiting
Sunshine
Sunshine
Sunshine
Pack your bags
Ah, won't you pack your bags
Ah, won't you pack your bags
Where would you like to go?
