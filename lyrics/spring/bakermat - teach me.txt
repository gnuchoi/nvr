Teach me master
Master teach me
Oh, I would not live
Live a liar
Teach me how to wait
I tell you the reason why
When I bow down at the altar
Teach me what to say

Cmon master
Teach me master, teach me
Cmon master
Teach me master, teach me
Cmon master
Teach me master, teach me
Cmon master
Teach me master, teach me
Cmon master
Teach me master, teach me
Cmon master
Teach me master, teach me

Teach me master
Master teach me
Oh, I would not live
Live a liar
Teach me how to wait
I tell you the reason why
Teach me how to wait
I tell you the reason why
When I bow down at the altar
Teach me what to say
I had my love, my car
And I would be ready to teach me master, teach me

Cmon master
Teach me master, teach me
Cmon master
Teach me master, teach me
Cmon master
Teach me master, teach me
Cmon master
Teach me master, teach me
Cmon master
Teach me master, teach me
Cmon master
Teach me master, teach me
Cmon master
