Walk little walk
Small talk big thoughts
Gonna tell them all just what I want
That street two streets I see you and me
Hanging on the empty swings
Count high low don't worry my eyes are closed
I'm a superman and it's my show
One shoe two
Gonna kick with my new shoes
I'm going to kick until I need new shoes

Yeah, yeah

I said uh-don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Talkin' to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Giving me things

I run they run everybody run run
And we're all just having fun
Sleigh ride boat ride piggy back-a ride
I'm going to show them all how I can ride
One two three close your eyes and count to four
I'm gonna (I'd like) to hide behind my bedroom door
Crayons on walls
I'll color on them all
I'll draw until I've broken every law

Yeah, yeah

I said uh-don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Talkin' to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Giving me things
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Laughin' about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop

[Instrumental break]

Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Talkin' to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Giving me things
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Laughin' about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop

[Strange laughing]

I said uh- don't stop, don't stop, don't stop [x4]
With me
