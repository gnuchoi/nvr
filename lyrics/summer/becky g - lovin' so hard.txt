You're the one I wanna talk about, talk about
Had a few but you knock 'em out, knock 'em out
Might just let you meet my mama now, mama now
Might just let you lock it, lock it down
'Cause I've been loving how you are with me, are with me
Ain't no fussing, ain't no arguin', arguin'
Every plane needs a pilot, pilot
Tell me baby who you're flying with?

Like ooh ah, wanna, wanna be around you
Got me breaking, breaking all of my rules oh
It's all the little things that you do
That got me like ooh (ooh)

When I wake up
You're the first thing that comes to mind
Wanna see you like all the time
Yeah we be lovin' so hard
When I wake up
You're the first thing that comes to mind
Wanna see you like all the time
Yeah we be lovin' so hard

We be lovin'
We be lovin' so hard
We be lovin'
We be lovin' so hard
Ain't nobody love him like I love him
Ain't nobody steal him
Damn we be lovin' hard
We be lovin'
We be lovin' so hard
We be lovin'
We be lovin' so hard
I'm miss him when I'm holding him
Miss him when I'm kissing him
Damn we be lovin' hard

Tryna find, find the words to say, words to say
To describe what you mean to me, mean to me
Side by side like a yin and yang, yin and yang
Like the stair up to my little wing

And it'd be hard, it'd be hard at times, hard at times
But in the dark boy you are my light, are my light
The boom boom to my dynamite, dynamite
Baby you, you my ride or die

Like ooh ah, wanna, wanna be around you
Got me breaking, breaking all of my rules oh
It's all the little things that you do
That got me like ooh (ooh)

When I wake up
You're the first thing that comes to mind
Wanna see you like all the time
Yeah we be lovin' so hard
When I wake up
You're the first thing that comes to mind
Wanna see you like all the time
Yeah we be lovin' so hard

We be lovin'
We be lovin' so hard
We be lovin'
We be lovin' so hard
Ain't nobody love him like I love him
Ain't nobody steal him
Damn we be lovin' hard
We be lovin'
We be lovin' so hard
We be lovin'
We be lovin' so hard
I'm miss him when I'm holding him
Miss him when I'm kissing him
Damn we be lovin' hard

We be lovin'
We be lovin' so hard
We be lovin'
We be lovin' so hard
Ain't nobody love him like I love him
Ain't nobody steal him
Damn we be lovin' hard
We be lovin'
We be lovin' so hard
We be lovin'
We be lovin' so hard
I'm miss him when I'm holding him
Miss him when I'm kissing him
Damn we be lovin' hard
