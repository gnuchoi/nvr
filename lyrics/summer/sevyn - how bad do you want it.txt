Oh yeah

Oh yeah

Oh yeah

Oh yeah

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

World goes round, life I chose
What comes next I never really know
A million miles left to go
Them guns go pow, but I'm ready for the war

'Cause I'll never run away
From who knocking at my door
I never paid attention to whoever tell me no
I'll take your crown, take your town
Better stay ready, better stay ready

If the sky start falling now
And the world stop turnin round
Oh yeah, did you give your everything?
You better give your everything!

'Cause if you want to ride with me
Oh yeah, make me come alive baby
Oh yeah, so if you want to ride with me
Oh yeah, if you want to ride with me

Show me how bad do you want it
How bad do you want it
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
How bad do you

Coming for it all, going for the gold
Hot behind the wheel, I'll never lose control
Sun go down, night unfold
Run free and wild, do anything I want

'Cause I'll never run away
From who knocking at my door
I never paid attention to whoever tell me no
I'll take your crown, take your town
Better stay ready, better stay ready

If the sky start falling now
And the world stop turnin round
Oh yeah, did you give your everything?
You better give your everything!

'Cause if you want to ride with me
Oh yeah, make me come alive baby
Oh yeah, so if you want to ride with me
Oh yeah, if you want to ride with me

Show me how bad do you want it
How bad do you want it
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
How bad do you

Better show me now
Before your time run out
Better show me
Before your time run out


Show me how bad do you want it
How bad do you want it
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
How bad do you
