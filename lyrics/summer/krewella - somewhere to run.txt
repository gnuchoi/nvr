I'm hearing the voices in my head
Telling me I should just pretend
But how can I sit around and swallow all the bullshit while I'm choking

I just need somewhere to run
I gave up, don't give a fuck
Somewhere to run, I'm so sick but I can't quit
I'm saying ooh, another day, another night, I'm getting through
I just want, I just want somewhere to run
Somewhere to run, somewhere to run
Somewhere to run, run, run

Say hello to the finger in your face
If you're telling me how I should behave
Cause you keep on walking while the leash around your neck has got you choking

I just need somewhere to run
I gave up, don't give a fuck
Somewhere to run, I'm so sick but I can't quit
I'm saying ooh, another day, another night, I'm getting through
I just want, I just want somewhere to run
Somewhere to run, somewhere to run
Somewhere to run, run, run

I've been through hell but I'm riding the sign 'til my feet hit the ground
I'm breaking out of myself, so don't hold me back cause I finally found
Somewhere to run, run, run
Somewhere to run, run, run
Somewhere to run, run, run
Somewhere to run

Somewhere to run, somewhere to run
Somewhere to run, somewhere to run, run, run
Somewhere to run, somewhere to run
Somewhere to run, run, run
