Oh, I know why you chasing all the headlights
Oh, 'cause you always tryna get ahead of light
Baby, when you go
You know I'll be waiting on the other side
And I know it's cold
But if you stay then I could keep you warm at night

Don't be a fool for the city nights
I know it's cold but it's only light
Baby, with you I can never lie
Don't go chasing all the headlights

Oh, I could feel the beating of your heart on drum
Oh, don't know if I'm dreaming or if you have gone
Every time you go
Hits me like a bullet from a golden gun
Yeah, I know it's cold
But if you stay then I could keep you warm at night

Don't be a fool for the city nights
I know it's cold but it's only light
Baby, with you I could never lie
So don't go chasing all the headlights
