Take your ho for the first time (one time)
And I only hit her one time (one time)

Lemme smash one time, lemme pass one time
Lil mama staring at me, hit the gas one time (Gas)

Only take one time for a nigga to snitch (Snitch)
Only take one time caught with a brick (Brick)
Bumping yo lip you get shot in yo shit

Hit a nigga with a choppa only one time
And i got the pocket rocket and it's on me all the time
My diamonds hit one time and it make you blind (Shine)

One gun with bout 200 round
They looking for you in the lost and found (where)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Only take one time for me to call my niggas up and they pulling up
Thinking bout running up Imma chop you with the choppa
Then i hit the runner up
My mansion's got expensive furniture
My favorite Corvette, it with the turbulence
Hit the gas one time, its over with
I'm in Vegas in casinos and I'm betting my poker chips
Just like a spider I web up the game
Whip up but they think its Peter Parker here
One song Versace and it got us the fame
Niggas plotting get one shot in your brain
Niggas biting but ain't gone say your name
Nigga my family only one gang
I came from the Northside and invaded the A
Start fucking up the city now we got our own lane
Now we blowing up like we on a mine
Givenchy khakis, Versace down my spine
Speeding in traffic I'm doing 200, that nigga say fuck the stop sign
Taking your bitch and I fuck her one time
But that bitch she be calling me more than one time
I drop a 8 one time, y'all drinking one line
You ain't never seen a hundred thousand dollar one time

[Hook]
