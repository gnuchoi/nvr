Here's why I did not go to work today.

Thursday's such a crazy, lazy day
Thursday has its own peculiar way of saying: ‘Hey’
Sometimes Thursday almost makes you want to run away
Thursday's such a crazy, lazy day.

Yeah, Thursday's such a crazy, lazy day, let's go have a picnic
Thursday's such a crazy, lazy day, hope it doesn't rain
When I'm feeling Thursday, I go and have a drink
If Thursday was a boat, I bet it'd sink.

I did on Monday, I tried on Tuesday
Wednesday's simply not my cup of tea
Thank Heaven, it's Friday, thank the Lord for the weekend
Thursday now, that's such a crazy, lazy day.

They say Monday's child is full of grace
Tuesday's child is fair of face
Thursday's child has far to go and it's no wonder
When the week becomes a rat race
You can bet, win, show or place
But never bet on Thursday ‘cause God's not on its case.

Thursday's such a crazy, lazy day, don't get me wrong
It's just that Thursday's twice as long as it should be, it's twice as long
Mondays, Tuesdays, weekends, Fridays don't get in my way
But Thursday's just a crazy, lazy day.

Monday is a blues day that goes for Tuesday
Wednesday's just the middle of the week, yeah, mmm
Friday is just another payday, the weekend's just another heyday
But Thursday's surreptitiously unique.

That's why I didn't go to work today
Thursday's got its own peculiar way of saying: ‘Hey’
Sometimes Thursday makes you want to run away
Thursday's such a crazy, lazy day
Thursday's such a crazy, lazy day.
