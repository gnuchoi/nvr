When I was a boy, I dreamed of a place in the sky
Playing in the fields, battling with my shields,
Bows made out of twine

I wish I could see this world again through those eyes
See the child in me, in my fantasy
Never growing old

Will we ever feel young, again
Will we ever feel young, again
Will we ever feel young, again

You wanna feel young
You wanna feel young, again

When I was a boy, I searched for a world that's unknown
All we have is fun, everybody runs, until the sun goes down

I wish I could see this world again through those eyes
See the child in me, in my fantasy
Never growing old

Will we ever feel young, again
Will we ever feel young, again
Will we ever feel young, again

You wanna feel young
You wanna feel young, again
